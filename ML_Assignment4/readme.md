To see the results for 1D visualization you have to run the file "visualization_1D.py". it will show the plots for linear kernel and RBF kernel seperatly (remember to close the plot that it shows and then it continues running to show the other plot). Also the plots will be saved in the 1D_visualization subfolder.

To see the results of MNLL using linear kernel for the 4 datasets you have to run the "linear_kernel.py" file. It will show the plots for all the 4 datasets. (remember to close the plot that it shows and then it continues running to show the other plots). Also the plots will be saved in the linearKernel_results subfolder.
 Also in terminal it shows the results like the following:

To see the results of MNLL using RBF kernel for the 4 datasets you have to run the "RBF_kernel.py" file. It will show the plots for all the 4 datasets. (remember to close the plot that it shows and then it continues running to show the other plots). Also the plots will be saved in the RBFKernel_results subfolder.
 Also in terminal it shows the results like the following:
